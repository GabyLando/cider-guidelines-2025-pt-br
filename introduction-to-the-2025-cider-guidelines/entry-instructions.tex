\begin{itemize}
\item Carbonation and sweetness levels are constrained in some styles; other levels are considered out-of-style. If a style lists no restrictions, then all levels are allowable.
\item Perceived carbonation is dependent on judging conditions, so specifying or requiring absolute volumes of CO2 is not necessary.
\item Declaring fruit varieties is allowable in any style.
\item Potential allergens must always be declared.
\item Vital Statistics are general guidelines, not absolutes. Commercial outliers certainly exist.
\end{itemize}
