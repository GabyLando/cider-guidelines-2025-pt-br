\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{C1. Traditional Cider}
\textit{Traditional Ciders are produced through fermenting apples without additional ingredients or unusual processes, and represent the regional traditions from many apple-growing areas of the world. The use of a geographic name in a style title does not imply an appellation â€“ ciders inspired by the originals may be produced anywhere, as long as they have a similar sensory profile. See the Introduction to Cider and Perry Styles for detailed sensory characteristics that apply to all styles.}
